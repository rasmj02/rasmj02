### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a student at Chalmers University of Gothenburg, currently residing in Gothenburg, Sweden.
Currently, I am studying automation, mechatronics, and deep machine learning.
I have a passion for coding and enjoy participating in orienteering events. During the winter, skiing is one of my favorite outdoor activities.
